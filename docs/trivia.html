          <li>His face is rumored to be a warning to all who see it.</li>
          <li>No one has ever heard him speak.</li>
          <li>
            He leaves behind a faint, static-like glitchy leftover after
            expunging something.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some theorize he is immune to all forms of magic and technology.
          </li>
          <li>
            He is often depicted in ancient texts as a shadow with a crimson
            face.
