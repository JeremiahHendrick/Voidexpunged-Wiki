        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
          Voidexpunged is silent, enigmatic, and seemingly emotionless. He
          rarely communicates, preferring to let his actions speak. Despite his
          terrifying powers, he is not overtly malicious; his motives are
          inscrutable, and some believe he acts to maintain a cosmic
          equilibrium, erasing only those who threaten the balance of the
          Voidverse.
